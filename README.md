# Connect-4
My first python project

This is my first official python project. I created an extremely simple version of connect-4 using an 8x8 board game asset. 
So far, I've only included the necessary features to make sure the game runs and recognizes if someone has won, lost or tied.
The game is also only 2-player. I have yet to implement an AI to make this a single-player game. 

Features to add:
Different AI levels
A menu screen
A victory/defeat/tie screen 
A "play again?" option
Timers for each player
A win/draw/loss count
An undo button
